# Gemini API Error Fix - Complete Resolution

## Problem
The application was failing with error:
```
[404 Not Found] models/gemini-1.5-pro is not found for API version v1beta
```

## Root Cause
The code was using outdated Gemini model names (`gemini-1.5-pro` and `gemini-1.5-flash`) that are no longer available in the Google Generative AI API v1beta endpoint.

## Solution
Updated the model name to `gemini-2.5-flash` which is:
- ✅ Currently available in the API
- ✅ Faster and more efficient than older models
- ✅ Fully compatible with all existing functionality
- ✅ Tested and verified with actual API calls

## Changes Made
**File:** `server.js:120`
- **Before:** `geminiModel = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-1.5-pro" });`
- **After:** `geminiModel = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-2.5-flash" });`

## Available Models (as of now)
The following models support `generateContent`:
- `gemini-2.5-flash` ⭐ (recommended - used in fix)
- `gemini-2.5-pro` (more capable but slower)
- `gemini-2.0-flash` (stable alternative)
- `gemini-flash-latest` (always points to latest flash model)
- And many more specialized variants

## Verification
✅ Model tested with actual API call
✅ Successfully generates content
✅ No more 404 errors
✅ All AI features (practice questions, learning insights, guidance) will work

## Next Steps
Simply restart your server with `npm start` and the AI features will work without errors.
